_________________________________________________________
 

In this project we chose to work with gnutella peer to peer strategy 
where each peer can act as both client and server

We opted for two approaches:
*-First approach: using java sockets 
*-Second approach: using RMI

Two packages are available describing the code and the execution of 
the two approaches.
The report sums up all the work done with more details.
